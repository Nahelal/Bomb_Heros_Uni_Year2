need to include:
- analysis of client server components
- class hierarchy, state models / data communication models
- consideration of issues in source material 

- good design of the clienr server components
- design looks realistic for implementation, which it would coz
  its gonna already have been made lol

-client and server work properly together locally 
- works properly together remotely

working support for sharding? what is thissssss

- justification of approach towards the project
- final design is fully functonal and containers have been deployed to registry


need to be clear and consise 
clear screenshots of code, make sure they are readable 
clear and simple blueprints 
uml flowcharts and state diagrams to show implemented behaviours


outline a problem that needs to be addressed (the research question)
outline the solution i have decided upon
outline the outcome of the solution and its impact

WHAT IS THE PROBLEM AND WHY IS IT AN ISSUE

can write about what worked in the end, the steps i had to do
to solve the problem, key features of the solution of how i solved
it using the solutions form, functions, and data models


parts of the poster,
- name and title
- problem definition
- soliution description
- modeling tools 
- outcome and impact

WIP NAME + TITLE:
comp260 artifact blah blah blah
lowenna whitehead 2102148

PROBLEM DEFINITION:

SOLUTION DEFINITION + WHAT THE ARTIFACT IS:
-screenshot of how the game looks and the ui for the project
-should also outline the work plan from before in a slightly more detailed, but less indepth overview.

RESEARCH:
outline the study that would in theory take place when testing my artifact against my research question, for example, being able to use the psm-9 in order to collect data for this. outline some of the questions or how the study would be conducted?

OUTCOME AND WHAT WORKED WELL:

WHAT COULD BE ADDED IN THE FUTURE:
probably going to have to be the upgrades and the things that are able to boost certain player stats, like explosion size and health bonuses. Change this from a random size for the explosion which is currently implemented

-also need to include a link to the github page with the artifact itself since the A3 poster is the final submission for the project

-MAKE SURE THE BIBLIOGRAPHY IS IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLS

make this on photoshop
