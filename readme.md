# COMP260 Distributed Systems: Artifact Technical Report
#### Word count: 


## what is it?

My artifact is going to be based around the 2007 game 'Bomb it' [1] with an added networking aspect to make the game online multiplayer instead of local multiplayer. My project is going to be a casual 2-4 player game, where the last player alive wins. The game premise involves collecting upgrades and moving around a 2d topdown map, where the player is placing bombs in order to destroy walls and reach the other players to eliminate them. I am also going to include a player log in and scoring system, where the players highscores are kept on their accounts on a database and can be referenced to create a global leaderboard which gives the players an insentive to not only eliminate players, but also to collect the upgrades to improve their own score.

similar games include 'Bomberman' [2] which is what bomb it is based on. has monsters that you have to destroy rather than players. you lose the social aspect and is not multiplayer, although more modern versions probably are? https://www.retrogames.cz/play_085-NES.php?language=EN



## what im testing?

casual gamign positively affecting mood.. competative but not intense or long games which can become a drag and unful very fast. fast paced games reduce this 
can improve mood and decrease stress
 


social interaction between players. game involves bombing people so does that have any affect on this at all? something to look into

can improve mood and decrease stress

casual games are simple to learn, short to play, colourful, easy to play, appeal to a mass market and not one specific type of person who enjoys a genre of games, dont require major time investment, doesnt matter if you win or lose etccc


What it means to be a casual gamer?
The term casual gaming refers to video games which do not require a major time investment to play, win, and enjoy. A casual gamer is a player who enjoys any video game without investing significant time to it, playing it spontaneously, irregularly, or infrequently

Casual games may exhibit any type of gameplay and genre. They generally involve simpler rules, shorter sessions, and require less learned skill


## how does it fit in my specialism?

This project fits into my distributed system specialism due to the fact that i am creating an online multiplayer game which will use a log in system for the players in order to play the game. This also allows the players game scores to be stored on their account which will be accessable on any device in which they log on to with the same account. This is due to the players information and scores being stored in a database which will be accessable to them when they log in.

## to do 
make a UML diagram to ecplain how the system is going to work!

also need academic research to back the research point up
 
 
 need to justify why im using unity
 make a class or uml diagram of game concept mechanics
 link project to previous networking projects or games that are similar 
 explain how the artifact is being tested against the research point 
 'with this artifact i aim to explore..' etcccc
 
 use easybib for gray literature citations 
 structure of network code but also of how the game works
 
 how im testing the research question - probs a survey of some sorts
 can alwasy use a study from a diff research paper 
 
 state similar games that hit research points 
 
 5-10 citations 
 
 
need an outline of the software design and architecture
software dev life-cycle
knowledge of system architectire and strong design 
defense argument found from research
research methods, primary and secondaryt research
structure, references and stuff
